# IPL-Data-Prediction
Analysis the IPL dataset
apply feature engineering technique and then visulaising the dataset by using seaborn library
After this predict the accuracy of the dataset by using different Machine Learning Algorithm like Random Forest, Decison Treee Clasifier, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine.
